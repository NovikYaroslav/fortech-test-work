## Refactoring in process

[Live Demo](https://pokedex-two-omega.vercel.app/)

## Task Description

You are required to build a web application with Pokemons using the free Pokemon API [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/). The application should have the following functionality:

- List pokemons in a table view (or cards) with their name, avatar, type (displayed as a colored tag), and main pokemon stats (any additional pokemon info you choose to show).
- Clicking on a pokemon in the list should display additional detailed information on a separate page.
- The list must include pagination with the ability to select how many items to show per page (10 / 20 / 50).
- Implement a search box to filter pokemons by name.
- Allow filtering pokemons by type using tags (multiple selected tags should show pokemons with any of the selected types).
- **In Progress: Store selected filters and pagination in the URL as query parameters.**

## Requirements

You must meet the following requirements:

- Develop the app with React and Redux (or any other state manager).
- The design is not crucial, but prioritize a good overall user experience and usability. You may use existing UI libraries like Material UI or AntD.
- Ensure the application is responsive, looking good on both mobile and desktop devices.**
- Lint the code, preferably using the eslint standard config ([eslint-config-standard](https://github.com/feross/eslint-config-standard)).
- Deploy the application online; Heroku, GitHub Pages, or any other free alternatives for deployment.
- Open-source the source code on GitHub.
