Task description
You need to build a web application with Pokemons. To this you need to use the free pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/). The application should have next functionality:

List pokemons in a table view (or cards) with their name, avatar, type (should visually look as a colored tag) and the main pokemon stats (whichever additional pokemon info you want to show)
When you click on a pokemon in the list, some additional detailed information should be shown on a separate page.

The list must have a pagination with an ability to select how many items to show per page (10 / 20 / 50)

Filter the pokemons by name with a search box

Filter the pokemons by type using tags (multiple selected tags have to show pokemons with any of the types selected)

Store selected filters and pagination in the url by query param

Requirements:
You have to meet the following requirements:
The app must be developed with React and Redux (or any other state manager)
